		"bio": " I`m a Florida based UX Designer that enjoys making meaningful designs through every day life. UX spiked my interest after 7 years in the motorcycle industry. Learning how to simplify a process to be more efficient while digging into the design process, and learning all the 'whys' behind the design is my new obsession. Design solutions are everywhere, who would have thought a red 'Go' button would make me change my whole career.",
