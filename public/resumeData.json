        "bio": "Hi there! I am Valdemir! You might also know me as Junior. I've been studying and coding for 1 year now. As a Junior Full Stack Developer, I have Studied at Bethel School of technology (reeding, California) for about 9 months in a Bootcamp. At the end of School, I realized a dream of developing a Stroke support group web application for Stroke Survivors to share their struggles and testimonies and also for Doctors to share treatments and hope to recover from it. Why? Because I survived a massive stroke at 36 years old paralyzing half of my body and fighting for more than 2 years to recover from it, since January 31st 2020 when it happened. with no medical condition or reason to have a stroke people and Doctors said I was supposed to be dead but I like to think I was supposed to be alive. Alive to cooperate, to give a testimony to encourage. Why did I decide to start coding? 1 Doctor advised me to find a job that would force my brain to think because I would depend on my brain from now on after being paralyzed. and the cognitive side of my brain was destroyed and I needed to force my brain to be restored, it is like a muscle I had to work on it, always working as a hardware technician coming to the USA from Brazil in 2004 I learned how to paint houses and I became the best of it, opened my first painting company in 2011(DNA Painting inc, my second in 2019, Anais Painting inc. having up to 20 employees. I  learned how to manage and work in a team.2020 was the year the stroke happened and I did stop all my business. And after the stroke going to achieve my dream to be able to develop.to code something I started in Brazil in 2004 at university but I could not finish because I had to leave the country and run to the USA. today as an American citizen in love with the culture and the people I want to Give back to this Country that has helped me so much. now it is the coding time!",
